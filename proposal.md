## Project Name: Rock Paper Scissors
### Project Summary: Group RPS (2+ players). Battles are compared clockwise (A -> B, B -> C, C -> A), you determine if elimination occurs during attack (ex. A -> B) or defense (ex. C -> A). Points will be tracked for wins, but session ends with “last person standing”.
